# USA plus layouts

![usa_plus](/res/usa_ita.png)

Do you think your macos layout is missing something? Do you spend most your
day switching between your favourite US layout and that bad italian layout?
Then this is for you.

Meet the USA PLUS layout.

## Description

This is USA layout but you can type accented characters with `OPTION+vocal`:

```
à   OPTION+a
è   OPTION+e
é   OPTION+r
ì   OPTION+i
ò   OPTION+o
ù   OPTION+u
```

Upper case characters can be typed by adding `SHIFT`, eg. `OPTION+SHIFT+e = È`.

Made with [ukelele](https://software.sil.org/ukelele/).

## Install

Copy the file `.bundle` inside `/Library/Keyboard Layouts/`, then log out and log in.

## Future work

- add other accented characters
- add euro €
- make for windows
